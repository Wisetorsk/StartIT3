                <span class="bold large">This</span> is a visualization of the set of complex numbers known in mathematics as the Mandelbrot set.<br />
                The complex number \(C\) is part of the Mandelbrot set if the resulting equation \(f_c(z) = z^2 + C\) does not diverge (Tends to move towards a value of \(_-^+infinity\))<br />
                This is calculated programmatically using \(Z_n = Z_{n-1}^2 + C\) as a base. <br /><br />
                A complex number concists of two parts, a real component(\(a\)), and an imaginary component(\(bi\)). \(C = a + bi \).<br />
                By further analysis of the number sequence given by Z, we can generalize the real and imaginary components of C in this way:<br /><br />
                &emsp;&emsp; \(C(real) = a^2 - b^2\)<br />&emsp;&emsp; \(C(imaginary) = 2ab\).<br /><br />
                By iterating through the values of \(C\) and checking the sub iterations \(Z\) we can determine if the given number \(C\) is part of the set by comparing it against a threshold value we determine. This is done to simplify the programming, since we can assume that if the number \(Z\) is rapidly approaching \(infinity\), then through even a few number of iterations, if the number exceeds our threshold value, we can assume that this number \(C\) is not part of the Mandelbrot set. <br /><br /><br />
