            Mathematical Rose Pattern Generator. This page plots the output of the polar function, r(θ) = cos(θ * κ). This function can be converted to cartesian coordinates, and the resulting functions for x and y is:
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-1">x(θ) = cos(κθ)cos(θ)</script><br />
            <script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-2">y(θ) = cos(κθ)sin(θ)</script><br />
            The value "steps" is the number of steps used to draw the function. <br />
            K alters the appearance of the function. <br />
            The last variable you can enter is the factor of PI the function will be plotted over<br /><br />
            K kan be any rational or irrational number. If K is an integer the following rules apply:
            <ul>
                <li>If κ is even the resulting graph will have 2*κ nodes.</li>
                <li>If κ is odd the resulting graph will have κ number of nodes</li>
            </ul>
            Where k is even, the entire graph of the rose will be traced out exactly once when the value of theta, θ changes from 0 to 2π. When k is odd, this will happen on the interval between 0 and π. (More generally, this will happen on any interval of length 2π for k even, and π for k odd.)
            
            <ul>
                <li>If k is a half-integer (e.g. 1/2, 3/2, 5/2), the curve will be rose-shaped with 4k petals. Example: n=7, d=2, k= n/d =3.5, as θ changes from 0 to 4π.</li>

            <li>If k can be expressed as n±1/6, where n is a nonzero integer, the curve will be rose-shaped with 12k petals.</li>

            <li>If k can be expressed as n/3, where n is an integer not divisible by 3, the curve will be rose-shaped with n petals if n is odd and 2n petals if n is even.</li>

            <li>If k is rational, then the curve is closed and has finite length. If k is irrational, then it is not closed and has infinite length. Furthermore, the graph of the rose in this case forms a dense set (i.e., it comes arbitrarily close to every point in the unit disk).</li>
