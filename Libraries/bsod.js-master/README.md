## Blue Screen of Death - BSOD.js

Wowee, web dev tools have been getting great these past few years, its never been easier to find, and debug probems online. The blue screen of death is a throwback to the days of old. You can "play" with it [here](http://tholman.com/blue-screen-of-death/).

Turn up your dev game to 11, and enter development hard mode by including `bsod.js` to your next project. This will cause a few things to happen.

1. Any js error will trigger the blue screen of death, instantly wiping the dom.
2. You'll see the annoying blue screen, complete with useless error message.
3. `bsod.js` will spam your console, making it tricky to see what actually caused the error!

## Here it is!

You can also set `window.bleu = true` to see the patented bleu screen of death. That'll really get those kids excited. Here's what that looks like:
